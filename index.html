        <h1>SYMPATHY EDITOR</h1>

<p>Sympathy is an in-browser text editor for Chrome, which allows you to edit <em>local files</em>. This means you
can browse to <code>file:///path/to/file.js</code> and it will open in Sympathy itself and you can save/edit it 
within Chrome itself. </p>

<p>Sympathy does not hit the web for any sort of sync ever. It is an alternative to simple text editors such as
geany/notepad++, but it works within your browser.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>Because the future is the browser? And more so because I wanted a local editor in my browser to complement
a terminal. Other than these three things, what more would you need? You can read the 
<a href="https://github.com/captn3m0/captn3m0.github.com/blob/master/_drafts/Sympathy-Editor.mkd">related blog post at my blog</a>
which gave birth to this editor. I was initially hoping for a chromium fork as I could not think of a way to 
get (good) local file access in chromium, but I recently heard about NPAPI plugins having full access to local
filesystem (and consequentially npapi-file-io).</p>

<h1>How?</h1>

<p>Sympathy does not use the HTML5 filesystem API. It instead relies on a NPAPI plugin called 
<a href="npapi-file-io.googlecode.com">npapi-file-io</a>. The plugin acts as a relay between the frontend 
and the filesystem, allowing you to save and read files, directories.</p>

<h1>What's Next?</h1>

<p>A move to use backbone.js is in progress (see the backbone branch). Lots of exciting features are planned as well.</p>

<h1>Compatability</h1>

<p>It only works with Linux/Windows as of now. But due to lac of npapi-file-io bindings for mac, it won't work there.</p>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>I have not yet decided on the licence, but it will probably be MIT/GPLv3.</p>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<ul>
<li>Feel free to add fork and add patches via github for new features. Please open an issue first
to make sure that I'm not already working on it.</li>
<li>If you are good in C++, contribute to the npapi-file-io plugin. It could really help us out.</li>
