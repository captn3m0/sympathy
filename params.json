{"name":"Sympathy","body":"#SYMPATHY EDITOR\r\n\r\nSympathy is an in-browser text editor for Chrome, which allows you to edit _local files_. This means you\r\ncan browse to `file:///path/to/file.js` and it will open in Sympathy itself and you can save/edit it \r\nwithin Chrome itself. \r\n\r\nSympathy does not hit the web for any sort of sync ever. It is an alternative to simple text editors such as\r\ngeany/notepad++, but it works within your browser.\r\n\r\n#[Install](https://github.com/downloads/captn3m0/sympathy/sympathy-editor-0.0.4.crx)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of manual page](http://db.tt/D4UdTZ5e)\r\n\r\n![file:// browsing](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1766113/screenshot/Index%20of%20-home-nemo-projects-captnemo.in-about-%20-%20Chromium.png)\r\n\r\n![bookmark support](http://db.tt/jtDy2bun)\r\n\r\n![new tab](http://db.tt/hpxJG4lt)\r\n\r\n#Why?\r\nBecause the future is the browser? And more so because I wanted a local editor in my browser to complement\r\na terminal. Other than these three things, what more would you need? You can read the \r\n[related blog post at my blog](https://github.com/captn3m0/captn3m0.github.com/blob/master/_drafts/Sympathy-Editor.mkd)\r\nwhich gave birth to this editor. I was initially hoping for a chromium fork as I could not think of a way to \r\nget (good) local file access in chromium, but I recently heard about NPAPI plugins having full access to local\r\nfilesystem (and consequentially npapi-file-io).\r\n\r\n#How?\r\nSympathy does not use the HTML5 filesystem API. It instead relies on a NPAPI plugin called \r\n[npapi-file-io](npapi-file-io.googlecode.com). The plugin acts as a relay between the frontend \r\nand the filesystem, allowing you to save and read files, directories.\r\n\r\n#What's Next?\r\nA move to use backbone.js is in progress (see the backbone branch). Lots of exciting features are planned as well.\r\n\r\n#Compatability\r\nIt only works with Linux/Windows as of now. But due to lac of npapi-file-io bindings for mac, it won't work there.\r\n\r\n##Licence\r\nI have not yet decided on the licence, but it will probably be MIT/GPLv3.\r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\n- Feel free to add fork and add patches via github for new features. Please open an issue first\r\nto make sure that I'm not already working on it.\r\n- If you are good in C++, contribute to the npapi-file-io plugin. It could really help us out.\r\n\r\nEditor Icon by [Asher](http://kyo-tux.deviantart.com/) used under [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)\r\n","tagline":"Local File Editor for Chrome using NPAPI","google":"UA-5922129-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
